## 🚀 **After Creating Buckets**

Your admin dashboard will now support:
- ✅ Direct image upload for products
- ✅ Direct image upload for COA reports

## 💡 **Alternative: Manual Upload (If You Don't Want to Use Supabase Storage)**

If you prefer NOT to use Supabase Storage, you can:

### **Option 1: Use Local Files**
1. Save images to `/public/coa/` folder
2. Use path: `/coa/filename.jpg`

### **Option 2: Use External Hosting**
1. Upload to Imgur: https://imgur.com
2. Right-click image → "Copy image address"
3. Paste URL in admin

---

## 🆘 **Still Getting Errors?**

If you see "bucket not found":
1. Make sure bucket names are EXACTLY: `menu-images` and `coa-images`
2. Make sure both are set to **Public**
3. Refresh your browser
4. Try uploading again

---

**Once buckets are created, image uploads will work perfectly! 🎉**
